## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-08

### Added

#### Core

- `CSSVar()` constructor for referencing CSS custom properties with `var()` output and OKLCh fallback extraction.
- CSS relative color syntax for CSSVar-backed Colors — `Color(cssvar, 'oklch(from var(--x) l c h / 0.5)')`.
- CSS `@property` declarations via `CSSVar.register()` with type, initial value, and inheritance control.
- `Color.lightDark(light, dark)` for automatic light/dark mode color switching.
- Native SVG gradient support: `LinearGradient()`, `RadialGradient()`, `ConicGradient()` constructors with trailing-block stop definitions.
- Gradient interpolation modes (`srgb`, `oklch`) and stepped interpolation via `.steps`.
- Pattern paint server: `Pattern()` constructor with embedded path drawing.
- Conic gradient `innerRadius` property for smooth center plateau effects (WebGPU-only rendering) with configurable `innerFill` (`'transparent'` default, `'center'`, or `Color(...)`).

- Laplace solver for TopoGradient (`method = 'laplace'`) — solves ∇²h = 0 via Jacobi iteration for smooth elevation fields. `iterations` property (default 200, range 1–2000).
- GroupLayer for SVG `<g>` element composition with `.append()`, max nesting depth of 10, and circular reference detection.
- Transform convenience properties (`translate-x`, `translate-y`, `translate`, `scale-x`, `scale-y`, `scale`, `rotate`) on PathLayer, GroupLayer, and TextLayer style blocks.
- First-class `Mask()` and `ClipPath()` constructors for SVG masking and clipping.
- `SVGDocumentFragment()` for injecting arbitrary SVG content (filters, markers, etc.).
- String type with `length`, `empty()`, index access, `split()`, `append()`, `prepend()`, `includes()`, and `slice()`.
- First-class `Point` type with `x`/`y` properties and geometric methods: `translate()`, `polarTranslate()`, `midpoint()`, `lerp()`, `rotate()`, `distanceTo()`, `angleTo()`.
- Objects with key-value literals, property access, `length`, `has()`, iteration, and `Object.keys()`/`values()`/`entries()`/`delete()` namespace methods.
- Path Blocks (`@{ ... }`) — reusable path data with `draw()`, `project()`, parametric sampling (`get`, `tangent`, `normal`, `partition`), transforms (`reverse`, `boundingBox`, `offset`, `mirror`, `rotateAtVertexIndex`, `scale`), properties (`length`, `vertices`, `subPathCount`, `subPathCommands`, `startPoint`, `endPoint`), and `<<` concatenation.
- `partition` `t` property and `subPath()` method on PathBlocks.
- `Cycler(array, shuffle?)` stdlib function for deterministic round-robin cycling with `.pick()` and `.length`.
- Matrix transforms (`translate`, `rotate`, `scale`) on layer contexts with `set()`/`reset()` and property access.
- Dynamic layer constructors — `PathLayer` and `TextLayer` names can be expressions.
- Universal tangent tracking for all SVG path commands.
- Line and column numbers in runtime error messages, including method calls.
- Void function call support (functions that return no value).
- Improved missing semicolon error diagnostics with targeted suggestions.

### Changed

#### Core
- Deprecated global stroke/fill controls in favor of per-layer styling.

#### Development
- Converted all scripts from JavaScript/Bash to TypeScript with Commander CLI framework for `--help`, argument parsing, and type safety.
- Scripts now run via `tsx` instead of `node`; added `commander` as a dev dependency.
- Added `scripts/CLAUDE.md` prescribing TypeScript + Commander conventions for new scripts.
- Git hook installer (`install-git-hooks.ts`) now writes shims that invoke TypeScript source via `npx tsx`.
- Added `playground/CLAUDE.md` and `src/CLAUDE.md` with conventions and workflow guardrails; refreshed project-level CLAUDE.md for multi-layer era.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-02-09

### Added

#### Core
- `else if` conditional chains — chain as many `else if` blocks as needed between `if` and `else`.
- `pi` numeric suffix for angle literals (e.g., `0.25pi`, `2pi`) and `mpi(x)` stdlib function for multiplying expressions by pi.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- `arcFromPolarOffset(angle, radius, angleOfArc)` - New context-aware function for drawing arcs where the center is at a polar offset from the current position. Guarantees continuous paths by only emitting `A` commands (never `M` or `L`). Positive `angleOfArc` draws clockwise, negative draws counter-clockwise.
- Context-aware functions documentation in `docs/stdlib.md` covering polar movement, arc functions, and tangent functions.
- Known issue ISSUE-002 documenting M command timing with context-aware functions.
#### Playground
- Autocomplete for the playground CodeMirror editor with snippets, stdlib functions, and context-aware completions.
- Save/load workspace support for `.svgx` files with File System Access API fallbacks and keyboard shortcuts.
- Refactored playground into modular Web Components with shared components, extracted styles, and state store.
- App shell + History API routing with landing, workspace, docs, preferences, and storybook views plus Cloudflare Pages deployment scaffolding.
- Blog feature in the playground with list and post views, markdown rendering, and build/new-post scripts.
- Enhanced component storybook with sidebar navigation, deep links, and interactive demos.
#### Documentation
- Documentation now generated from markdown sources via `scripts/build-docs.js`, including new getting-started/debug content and syntax updates.
- Syntax highlighting for docs using highlight.js (GitHub Dark theme).

#### Development
- Added an optional post-commit hook installer (`scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`) to remind contributors to update `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Fixed

#### Core
- `arcFromCenter` now emits `L` (lineto) instead of `M` (moveto) to reach the arc start point. This keeps paths continuous so that `Z` (closepath) closes to the original path start, not the arc start. If the current position already matches the arc start, only the `A` command is emitted.

#### Deployment
- SPA routing on Cloudflare Pages now supports direct navigation to playground routes via `_worker.js` and a base href update.

### Changed

#### Core
- `arcFromPolarOffset` uses the convention that positive `angleOfArc` is clockwise and negative is counter-clockwise, matching the visual behavior in SVG's Y-down coordinate system.

#### Deployment
- Build output moved to `public/` for Cloudflare Pages auto-detection.

#### Branding
- Page titles updated to include Pedestal Design branding.
